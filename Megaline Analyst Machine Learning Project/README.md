As an analyst for Megaline, a mobile carrier, you find out that many of their subscribers use legacy plans. Megaline has come out with newer plans and wants to transition their legacy plan users to these new plans: Smart or Ultra. We will develop a machine learning model that would analyze subscribers' behavior and recommend one of the newer plans. 

# Table of Contents:
1. General Information
2. Spliting into test/train/validation set
3. Fitting the data set and finding the best accuracy (hyperparameter tuning)
4. Quality & Sanity check
5. Conclusion
# **Data**
* *calls* - number of calls,
* *minutes* - total call duration in minutes,
* *messages* - number of text messages,
* *mb_used* - internet traffic used in MB,
* *is_ultra* - plan for the current month (Ultra - 1, Smart - 0)

# **Goal:**
 To develop a mode that would analyze subscribers' behaviors and to recommend a plan.

# **Libraries used:**
 *pandas, matplotlib, numpy, sklearn (DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForest, Logistic Regression, Linear Regression)*
