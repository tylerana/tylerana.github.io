OilyGiant mining company wants to build a new well, but is having trouble picking between regions. We are tasked with building a model to find the best region with the highest profit margin.

# Table of Contents:
1. Download and prepare data
2. Train and test the model for each region
3. Prepare for profit calculation
4. Write a function to calculate profit from a set of selected oil wells and model predictions
5. Calculate risks and profit for each region

# **Data**
**Technological process**

* *Rougher feed* — raw material
* *Rougher additions*(or reagent additions) — flotation reagents:

Xanthate, Sulphate, Depressant

    * Xanthate — promoter or flotation activator;
    * Sulphate — sodium sulphide for this particular process;
    * Depressant — sodium silicate.

* *Rougher process* — flotation
* *Rougher tails* — product residues
* *Float banks* — flotation unit
* *Cleaner process* — purification
* *Rougher Au* — rougher gold concentrate
* *Final *Au* — final gold concentrate

**Parameters of stages**
* *air amount* — volume of air
* *fluid levels*
* *feed size* — feed particle size
* *feed rate*

# **Goal:**
Build a model that will help to pick the region with the highest profit margin. Analyze potential profit and risks using the Bootstrapping technique.

# **Libraries used:**
*pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplotlib, sklearn (ensemble, linear_model, metrics)*
