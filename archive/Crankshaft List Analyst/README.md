As an analyst at Crankshaft list, we know there is hundereds of free advertisements for vehicles are published on our site daily. However, what factors influence the price of a vehicle? We need to study data collected over the last few years and determine which factors influence the price of a vehicle. 

# **Table of Contents**
1. Study general information
2. Data preprocessing
3. Calculate and add the table to the following:
   * Day of the week, month, and year the ad was placed
   * The vehicle's age (in years) when the ad was placed
   * The vehicle's average mileage per year
4. Exploratory Data Anlysis
   * ex: Study the following parameters: price, vehicle's age when the ad was placed, mileage, number of cylinders, and condition. Plot histograms for each of these parameters. Study how outliers affect the form and readability of the histograms.
5. Conclusion

# **Data**
* *price*
* *model_year*
* *model*
* *condition*
* *cylinders*
* *fuel* — gas, diesel, etc.

* *transmission*
* *paint_color*
* *is_4wd* — whether the vehicle has 4-wheel drive (Boolean type)

* *days_listed* — from publication to removal

# **Goal:**
Conduct exploratory data analysis to find which factor influence the price of a car. This can be found by studying whether the price depends on age, mileage, condition, transmission type, and color

# **Libraries used:**
