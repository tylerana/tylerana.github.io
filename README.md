# Practicum by Yandex Projects


This repository contains data science projects I have completed through my data science bootcamp [Practicum by Yandex](https://practicum.yandex.com/).

| Project Name  | Description | Libraries used|
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [Analyzing Borrower Risk](https://github.com/tylerana/tylerana.github.io/tree/main/Analyzing%20Borrowers'%20Risk)  | Given data on customer's credit worthiness, I determined if a customer's marital status and number of children have an impact on whether they will default on a loan. | pandas |
| [Crankshaft List Analyst](https://github.com/tylerana/tylerana.github.io/tree/main/Crankshaft%20List%20Analyst)  | As an analyst at Crankshaft List, hundreds of free advertisements for vehicles are published on the site every day. I studied data collected over the last few years and determined which factors influence the price of a vehicle.  | pandas, numpy, matplotlib  |
| [Ice Videogame Analyst](https://github.com/tylerana/tylerana.github.io/tree/main/Ice%20Videogame%20Analyst)| Identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This allows me to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns.| pandas, matplotlib, numpy, scipy, seaborn, math|
|[Telecom Plans ML Model](https://github.com/tylerana/tylerana.github.io/tree/main/Megaline%20Analyst%20Machine%20Learning%20Project) | Mobile carrier Megaline has found out that many of their subscribers use legacy plans. They want to develop a model that would analyze subscribers' behavior and recommend one of Megaline's newer plans: Smart or Ultra.| Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Sklearn |
[Beta Bank Customers](https://github.com/tylerana/tylerana.github.io/tree/main/Beta%20Bank%20Customers) | Beta Bank customers are leaving: little by little, chipping away every month. Given data on clients' past behavior and termination of contracts with Beta Bank, build a model with the maximum possible F1 score. | pandas, numpy, sklearn |
[Oil Well Model](https://github.com/tylerana/tylerana.github.io/tree/main/Oil%20Well%20Model) | You have data on oil samples from three regions. Parameters of each oil well in the region are already known. Build a model that will help to pick the region with the highest profit margin. Analyze potential profit and risks using the Bootstrapping technique. | pandas, numpy, scipy, sklearn, matplotlib.pyplot|
[IMDB Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/tylerana/tylerana.github.io/tree/main/IMDB%20Sentiment%20Analysis) | Given reviews from IMDB, build and train a model to automatically detect negative moview reviews. |tensorflow, sklearn, matplotlib, seabron, tqdm, lightgbm, nltk, spacy|
[Time series Cab Fare Prediction](https://github.com/tylerana/tylerana.github.io/tree/main/Timeseries%20Cab%20Fare%20Prediction) | Time Series Analysis, Python, Sci-kit Learn, Regression
[Customer Age Detection](https://github.com/tylerana/tylerana.github.io/tree/main/Customer%20Age%20Detection%20Project) | Computer Vision, Keras, CNN, Python
